# stockpile-api
The API for Stockpile, an app that manages stuff for organizations.  

[Read the docs.](https://stockpile.adamvig.com/docs)

See [stockpile-app](https://github.com/emmanuelroussel/stockpile-app) for the web and mobile application that consumes this API.  

## Scripts
Yarn presents the same API as npm for running scripts. The scripts below are defined in `package.json`.  
 * `yarn start` start the app in production
 * `yarn stop` stop the app in production
 * `yarn test` test code using [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava)
 * `yarn run dev` run the app in development
 * `yarn run lint` lint code using [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) + [StandardJS](http://standardjs.com/)
 * `yarn run docs` generate documentation using [Docco](https://jashkenas.github.io/docco/)

## Environment Variables
You must define environment variables in a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Use `.env.example` as a template. The app will fail to start if any of the variables in `.env.example` are undefined.  
Environment variables are loaded into the app and can be accessed in any file with `process.env.VAR_NAME`.  
Override variables at run-time by defining them with the command, like `VAR_NAME=value yarn start`.  

### Example Environment Variables
```
NODE_ENV=prod
PORT=9999
DB_URL=example.com
DB_USER=db-user
DB_PASSWORD=9234kjhsdfnmb234
DB_NAME=my_db
JWT_SECRET=392skdjlhfbjkmnb3425lkdfg
API_URL=https://example.com/api/
```

Note that the format of `DB_URL` is flexible because it is passed to the Knex constructor.  
Note that `API_URL` must begin with `http://` or `https://` and end with `/`.  

## Tests
Tests are located in `./test` and are run asynchronously in parallel with `yarn test`.  

## Documentation
Documentation is located in `./docs` and is generated by running `yarn run docs`.  

Documentation is generated by two providers: [apiDoc](http://apidocjs.com/) (`./docs/apidoc`) and [JSDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) (`./docs/jsdoc`).  

### apiDoc
Similar to JSDoc, but specifically intended for APIs, it uses [many powerful parameters](http://apidocjs.com/#params) to generate documentation from docstyle comments.  

Comments should be on the endpoint declaration (for example, `app.get(...)`), not the controller function that the endpoint uses (for example, `module.exports.getAll`). Configuration for the ApiDoc generator is located in `package.json` under the `apidoc` property.  

### JSDoc
The services located in `./services` are documented with JSDoc. This documentation is useful when building on the API.  

Configuration for the JSDoc generator is located in `.jsdoc.json`.  

## Deploying
Deployments are made via Git push to a bare remote repository on the server. A post-receive hook runs every time a push is made to the repository, copying the new files to the web root, restarting the server, and generating documentation. This is the script:  
```bash
APP_DIR=/var/www/stockpile-api

printf "Copying files..."
GIT_WORK_TREE="$APP_DIR" git checkout -f
printf " %s\n" "Done."

cd "$APP_DIR"

printf "Installing dependencies..."
yarn install

printf "Restarting app..."
npm restart
printf " %s\n" "Done."

printf "Generating docs..."
yarn run docs
printf " %s\n" "Done."
```

Commits to master should be made only via merged pull requests. Each merged pull request should increment the version number in `package.json` using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). This version number can be used to version API endpoints, so it should be kept up to date.  

## Adding New Routes
All route logic is contained in controllers representing individual endpoints. Each controller should contain all of the relevant actions for an endpoint. Example controller:  
```JavaScript
// controllers/example.js
module.exports.get = (req, res, next) => {
  try {
    res.send('example')
  } catch (err) {
    next(err)
  }
}
```

Controller exports should be named for what they *do* not what HTTP verb they will be associated with. For example, use `module.exports.update` instead of `module.exports.put`.  


Routes are defined in `./controllers/routes.js`. Example of defining a route:  
```JavaScript
// controllers/routes.js
const example = require('./example')

module.exports = (app) => {
  app.get({name: 'get example', path: '/example'}, example.get)
}
```

Each route *must* have a descriptive, unique `name` property. Route names are used in defining relations, which show up in the `_links` property of responses. Restify removes spaces, special characters, and uppercase letters from route names, so there is no need to camelcase or kebab-case them.
